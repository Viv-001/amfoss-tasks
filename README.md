## 🎯 Why Should You Choose Me?

- I've taken the initiative to build some cool projects like AI-based apps and an RFID payment system for school. They show I’m practical and can solve problems.

- I’m always open to learning new stuff and have been exploring web development, AI, robotics, and some mobile experimenting.

- I'm good at explaining things clearly and working well with others.

- When I don’t know something, I’m good at searching for the right info online and figuring things out ( an avid web surfer btw).

- I don’t give up on tough challenges. I keep at it until I solve the problem.
